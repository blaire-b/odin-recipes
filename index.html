        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center;">The purpose of this project is to create a website with links to 3 recipe pages. The recipes I chose are meals I have made numerous times and enjoy. The best part about cooking is that you can use the ingredients you choose, and turn them into something nourishing for your body. I hope you enjoy these recipes as much as I do!</p>
