        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is super easy, yet it creates the most delicious bread that will amaze you, and your tastebuds with its perfection.</p>
        <p>I have made this bread for parties, serving with garlic olive oil mix or spinach dip, and it is always devoured by the end of the night. What makes it so easy, is the fact that most of the magic is done in the waiting. Once the ingredients are mixed, there is a 8-12 hour wait required for the bread to rise. Additionally, the time in the dutch oven creates an unbelivably soft bread with a super crisp exterior. What are you waiting for, you need to make this bread right now!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all purpose flour - if substituting whole wheat, only sub up to 1/2 ww, otherwise bread becomes too hard</li>
            <li>1 cup hot water</li>
            <li>3 tsp yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp oil (optional)</li>
        </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yeast and water. Let it rest for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in flour to the yeast mixture. You can use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this, set to low as dough will form quickly.</li>
        <li>Let dough rest 5 minutes, then form into a ball</li>
        <li>Place dough ball into dutch oven, cover, and bake for 50 minutes at 350 degrees</li>
        <li>Remove lid and bake for 5 more minutes to brown top of bread.</li>
        <li>Take bread out of oven and let rest for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Serve warm and enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
